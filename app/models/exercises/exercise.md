# Exercise

`Exercise`s are dynamically generated by the app based on `UnitOfMeaning` objects.

They come in different flavors. The base class is abstract.
Every exercise must have an `instruction`. They also have a field `blockedBy`, a non-symmetric many-to-many to other `Exercise`s.

Later, we may add learning data tracking to Exercises (as well as to learning goals).
