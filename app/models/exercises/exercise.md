# Exercise

`Exercise`s are dynamically generated by the app based on `UnitOfMeaning` objects.

They come in different flavors. The base class is abstract.
Every exercise must have an `instruction` & `createdAt`. They also have a field `blockedBy`, a non-symmetric many-to-many to other `Exercise`s.

An exercise belongs to a single `UnitOfMeaning` (from which it was generated).

## Flavors

## Exercise Flashcard

Has a `front` and a `back` property.

## Exercise Todo

No additional props.


## Data Maintainance Notes

- `Exercise`s may be generated ad-hoc in quite larger numbers. That doesn't mean they will actually be practiced. Therefore, it may be an option to make a management command (at a later point) clearing out `Exercise`s which have no `ExerciseProgress` attachd (for no user).
